I have implemented the exercise using PHP MVC architecture.

E:\Using MVC\source\core\data - Data folder contains script for Product table.

E:\Using MVC\source\core\modules - added 2 modules Product and Checkout.

E:\Using MVC\source\core\modules\Product\models - contains Product model.

E:\Using MVC\source\core\modules\Checkout\controllers - CheckoutController.php have actions which would display cart page and even some implementations/calculations for cart page.

E:\Using MVC\source\core\modules\Checkout\views - index.php will display cart page and related operations would be handled there.




E:\Using MVC\source\core\modules\Product\controllers - I haven't added any Controllers under controllers, but it would contain actions related to implementation and CRUD operations.

E:\Using MVC\source\core\modules\Product\views - I haven't added any views under views folder of Product module, buit it would contain user interfaces for create, update, delete, view of products and even PLP and PDP pages.

E:\Using MVC\source\core\modules\Checkout\models - It doesn't contain any model.
